TODO for mmap_allocator
-----------------------

Have a option to set verbosity at runtime, instead of having to recompile.

Allow remapping of already mapped vectors.

Support for STL strings.

Convert bool parameters to bit flag.

Option to not use mempool (always_remap or so).

Have more converters between mmappable_vectors and plain STL vectors.

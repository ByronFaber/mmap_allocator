TODO for mmap_allocator
-----------------------

Done:

Option to not use mempool (bypass_file_pool).

Convert bool parameters to bit flag.

Have a option to set verbosity at runtime, instead of having to recompile.

For 0.6:

Allow remapping of already mapped vectors.

Have more converters between mmappable_vectors and plain STL vectors.

make install should do what one expects (-> install_sources).

Compile as a shared library.

For 0.7:

Support for STL strings.

Later:

Support for other platforms

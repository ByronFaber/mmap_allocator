TODO for mmap_allocator
-----------------------

Done:

Option to not use mempool (bypass_file_pool).

Convert bool parameters to bit flag.

Have a option to set verbosity at runtime, instead of having to recompile.

Compile as a shared library.

make install should do what one expects (-> install_sources).

Have more converters between mmappable_vectors and plain STL vectors.

For 0.7:

Support for STL strings.

Later:

Support for other platforms
	At least test different gcc / libstdc++ implementation.

Allow remapping of already mapped vectors.

Conversion function template from std vectors to mmapped vectors (if possible):
	Only can convert from mmappable_vectors to std::vectors, don't 
	know how to convert the other way.
